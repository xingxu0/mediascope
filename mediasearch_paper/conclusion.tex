\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-6}

In this paper, we have discussed the MediaScope, a system that bridges
the availability gap for visual media by supporting timely on-demand
retrieval of images and video.
%
MediaScope uses a credit-based timeliness-aware scheduling algorithm
that optimizes query completeness, and its overheads are moderate.
%
\camera{Much work remains, including optimizing the internals of the
  system to improve completeness, and supporting more geometric
  queries on visual media.
%
  Larger scale experiments using more mobile devices can help
  understand how well the system scales, and how network variability
  can impact query completeness.
%
  Finally, a user study focused on understanding how well \mscope's
  query results bridge the semantic gap can help establish \mscope's
  usefulness.
